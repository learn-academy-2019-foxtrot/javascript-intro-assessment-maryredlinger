1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is the entire action of your javaScript code. It is a way of passing differnt variable and values to perform a certain action and function. It's a way to bring action to your website when you connect js to your html

  Researched answer: .concat() .some() .shift() .reverse() .pop()



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log calls on the function to spit out an action while return is within the function. A return happens when the function its in is called on by the console.log

  Researched answer: return is a statement that allows a function to output a value back to where it was called. console.log is a function that lets us inspect values for debugging purposes.




4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: An argument is the variable that is being passed into the function. A variable is the definied item that is in the argument and is taken by a place holder through the function.

  Researched answer: arguments is an Array -like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition. Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.






5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programers should work together in a professional and friendly way. There needs to be an even time split between who is the driver and naviagator as well as taking a healthy amount of breaks. The driver is the person that is in control of the keyboard and mouse while the other person is the driver and directs the code watching out for typos and potential bugs.

  Researched answer:Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.




6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript is a way to bring your website to life by allowing for interactions between the user and the website itself.
